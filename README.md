# Lab-simulation
 
Lab 6. Created a simple cloth simulation using Blenders own modify tools. Applied the cloth sim to the leather strap of the cooler. Then pinned the verticies located at each end of the leather strap object to make it appeared attached to the cooler object. Within the settings of the cloth sim I added stickiness so that the strap is less likely to phase through other objects when moving them around.
I also added collision to the leather strap handle and the cooler so that the leather strap can detect what are solid objects. adjusted the stickiness setting to the strap handle collision to also prevent phasing.
